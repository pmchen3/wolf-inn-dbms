# Wolf Inn DBMS
A management system for hotel database.

The Wolf Inn program was made to connect to a MariaDB system. The program is used to manage hotel information, such as staff, customers, rooms, check-ins, and billing. A menu with a set of commands is provided to the end user (the staff) to modify or query information as needed. User input is used to build the corresponding SQL statement to send to the DBMS.

The table data file provides a list of statements for creating the tables used in the database and inserting sample data.
